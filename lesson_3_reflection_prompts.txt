When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So as to work with others and to have an online copy of my work/history i can pull form anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because there is a difference between a version which I want to be published or I want my coworkers to work with and the one I'm working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
